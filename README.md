Patches for the Terminal Tedium

Note: Its quite possible many of these patches are based on my TTuiLite repo, 
and so need sidekick installed, please see that repo for details.


also unless otherwise mentioned, these are kind of private patches, that may be in a state of flux.
so consider them as inspiration for your own patches.
Given limited tim, I do not support them.
